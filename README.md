# Memory Card Game
A 4x4 grid of tile rectangles, and a black panel on the right are displayed. 
When a tile is clicked, it flips over. When a second tile is clicked, it also 
flips face up. If the tiles match,both tiles stay face up. If the tiles do not 
match, both tiles flip face downagain. The game continues until the player 
matches all the tiles, or clicks the 'x' in the top right of the window.

The first version must contain the complete tile grid and the black panel on the
right, but there should be no score in the black panel. All 8 pairs of two tiles
must be exposed when the game starts. Each time the game is played, the tiles 
must be in random locations in the grid. Player actions must be ignored.
